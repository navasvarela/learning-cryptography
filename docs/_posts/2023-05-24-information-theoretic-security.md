# Introduction

There are a big family of cryptographic protocols and encryption schemes that are based on the hardness of specific mathematical problems. For example:
- [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)), relies on the difficulty of solving the [factoring problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_problem)
- [ElGamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_cryptosystem), relies on the difficulty of solving the [discrete logarithm problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm)
